# Lab-6
Computer Architecture Lab Assignment

For this lab, I created a ROM module for a processor which uses RISC-V ISA. This ROM holds 19 specified instructions, each being 32 bits wide.

ROM is read only memory. Some ROMs are erasable or electrically erasable and programmable. The ROM I designed to hold the 19 specified instructions for this lab is not erasable or programmable. It only stores the instructions which are specified in the Verilog code.
